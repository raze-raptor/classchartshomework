# Class Charts

I am making a project that I can use so people can track class charts more efficently.

## How this will work.

I will use the [Unofficial Class Charts API](https://classchartsapi.github.io/api-docs/) as there isn't an official one I can use at the moment. No clue what I really am doing but whatever happens, happens!
